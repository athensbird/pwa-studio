# Why UPDOG for Magento PWA Studio

Magento PWA Studio is meant to be cheap and easy to run; it should not be tied to a specific tech stack. A middle tier server is necessary to decouple PWA Studio from the Magento Theme resolution tier, which requires two-way binding in the filesystem. UPDOG allows us to require this middle tier without requiring a specific tech stack.
